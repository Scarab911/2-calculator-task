# Brainnest week-4 JavaScript assignment, calculator project

Hello my name is Paul'ius and this project is meant to show case how I completed [**'Brainnest'**](https://www.brainnest.consulting/) frontend programs week 4(which was about JS and DOM) calculator project.

Techniques used is **HTML** for layout and **CSS** for styling. **JavaScript** without classes and methods, just pure functions and DOM manipulation methods.

Calculator design somewhere from the google search.

### Calculator asignment key points:

---

- _Basic math_ (add, substract, multiply, divide)
- Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and
  an “Equals” key.
- Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
- Make calculator work
- Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you
  don’t let them type more than one.
- Add a “backspace” button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
- Add keyboard support.

### My personal additions:

---

- On **ERROR** then user tries divide by 0, screen blinks `red` (css animation and classList.Add method) untile AC button is pressed.
